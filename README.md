# HTTPD broken cartridge for training cartridge writers

This is an intentionally broken cartridge.  It's intended to be used by
cartridge writers who want to better understand how to create cartridges
as well as better hone their troubleshooting skills.

It's intended to be used as a downloadable cartridge and comes with several bugs. So good luck finding and fixing
them.  Happy hacking!
